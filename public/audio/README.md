# Sound Credits

The sounds used in this game are placeholders.

Since direct downloads from external sites are not working properly, you would typically use:

1. Royalty-free sound effects and music from sources like:
   - [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)
   - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
   - [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)

2. In a production environment, you would download the actual MP3 files and place them here.

For now, the game will use the Audio API to generate sounds programmatically.
